<h1>Synaptech Solutions Ltd.</h1>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><em>Last updated: 10 December 2025</em></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Synaptech Solutions Ltd. (“Synaptech”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information in connection with our websites, applications, integrations, and other products and services (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

<p>By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you must not use the Services.</p>

<h2>1. Who We Are and Scope of This Policy</h2>

<p>Synaptech Solutions Ltd. is an Ontario corporation based in Canada. We provide business-to-business (“B2B”) software-as-a-service solutions, including AI-enabled tools, integrations, and automations.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Through our websites and web applications;</li>
    <li>Through our mobile, desktop, and native applications;</li>
    <li>Through our APIs, messaging bots, voice interfaces, and other delivery channels;</li>
    <li>When you communicate with us (for example, by email or support requests); and</li>
    <li>From Third-Party Services you choose to connect to the Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Privacy Policy does <strong>not</strong> apply to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Third-party websites, services, or applications that we do not control, even if they integrate with or are accessed through the Services; or</li>
    <li>Information processed solely by our customers in their own systems, outside of our Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where we process personal information on behalf of a business customer (for example, information about that customer’s employees, vendors, or end customers), we generally do so as a <strong>service provider/processor</strong>, and our processing is governed by our agreement with that customer (including our Terms of Service). In those cases, the customer’s own privacy policies will generally apply to that personal information.</p>

<h2>2. Who Should Use the Services</h2>

<p>The Services are intended for business and professional use only. They are not aimed at individual consumers for personal, family, or household purposes.</p>

<p>The Services are <strong>not directed to, and are not intended for use by</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Individuals or organizations established in, ordinarily resident in, or accessing the Services from any member state of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EEA); or</li>
    <li>Individuals or organizations established in, ordinarily resident in, or accessing the Services from the United Kingdom.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are located in any of these regions, you must not use the Services.</p>

<p>The Services are also not intended for children or minors. You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher) to use the Services.</p>

<h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
